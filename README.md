# -getting-and-cleaning-data-week-4-project

CodeBook describes how to use variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

run_analysis.R contains all the code to perform the analysis described in the 5 steps. It can be launched in RStudio by just importing the file, and later, you should follow the next steps:

Merges training and test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the mean of the measurements and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
tidy_data.txt is the output of the final step
